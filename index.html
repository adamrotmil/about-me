    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm a designer / developer who loves to travel and has worked for some of the largest companies in the world. Currently I'm a digital designer at EY, where I spend a lot of time designing graphics for mobile devices. I recently traveled to China and have lived in Japan. Next year I will travel to Greece. I am now reading Die Empty, a book on organization and motivation by Todd Henry.</p>

    <p>What matters to me is knowing that I have given it my all -- and that likewise my colleagues and superiors have worked with honesty, respect and determination to bring out our best work together.</p>

    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I grew up in Maine, in the middle of nowhere, where the fun never came to town. So, my friends and I had to form our own bands and make our own events. This is actually how I got into graphic design. It's also how I learned that if you can visualize it, you can probably make it happen.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>

    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I like listening to music, traveling, learning foreign languages, cooking, doing (some) exercise, hanging out with family, playing Go, and just getting into those moments where you're thinking, "man, I can't believe I'm actually here, doing this!" </p>

    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>I think I'd like to reflect on this more duing 2015. In my mind's eye, I'd be coding, designing, and sometimes traveling, for an organization or nimble agency that values effort and initiative, and develops its people over time.</p>
